# LAB ONBOARDING

[CITI Training](https://researchservices.cornell.edu/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control) - This training is required for students involved in human-subjects research. Upon completion, send your certificate to Angelique.

[Qualitative Research training](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/research-support/workshops-and-training#descriptions) (statistics, data collection and preparation)

**MakerLAB Safety-Training** is required for students interested in building things! – Contact [Niti Parikh](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/niti-parikh/) (<ntp27@cornell.edu>) for information about the training.

**Access to Lab Space** – Contact Tamika Morales to get access (<tm497@cornell.edu>) to the lab space in Tata.

PhD students in departments outside of Information Science - have the option to start at Cornell Tech or Ithaca campuses.

Mental Health Services: I encourage students to take advantage of the mental health services provided at Cornell Tech ([see here](https://studentaffairs.tech.cornell.edu/health-wellness/nyc-health-resources/)).

## GRADUATE STUDENT ONBOARDING

Lab Meetings take place biweekly, day of week-TBD.

One-on-one meetings occur weekly with PhD students and biweekly with all other students.

## RESEARCH & PUBLISHING

**Independent Research**: As PhD students, you are expected to identify a problem domain to focus on for your dissertation. This will take time to formulate but all of you should start thinking about what you're interested in (read, read, read papers for inspiration!)

**Lab research**: You will also be involved in research dedicated to the lab's mission. These projects are driven by research funding and potential grants for the future. The hope is that your lab research and independent research are closely aligned. We will work together to ensure this. Our early work will serve as preliminary work in future grants.

**Publishing**: Students are expected to inform Angelique of intended paper submission at least 3 months before the deadline. A near-complete draft is required to be submitted for review at least 4 weeks before the paper deadline to ensure enough time available to iterate on it and generate a high-quality paper submission.

## FUNDING

PhD students can have external funding (from fellowships, scholarships, etc), internal funding by the department (by serving as a TA), or from funding we raise from grants.

Generally, PhD students are expected to publish a high quality research paper before interning in industry, which is a nice way to be funded over the summer. PhD students are encouraged to apply for fellowships other than those that require a summer internship before publishing a high quality research paper in preparation for the A-exam.

For U.S. citizens: I encourage you to seek external funding opportunities i.e., fellowships from NSF, MSF, Meta, etc. These are helpful because it gives you more freedom in your research.

For International students, there are many industry fellowships available including from Meta Reality Labs, Adobe, Microsoft, NVIDIA, [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/), ([more here](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/phd/fellowships.html))

I'll be applying for grants soon and will seek your feedback and help with writing them. My hope is to craft our research narrative together so it's important that you all spend a lot of time reading and getting familiar with the field.

## LAB WEBSITE

To keep the lab website up-to-date, send Angelique the following data so you can be included:

- Professional Headshot

- Research Interests – provide a brief description of your research interests. These will likely change over time so send Angelique updates when needed.

- Website URL - If you do not have a website, you can make a website here: <https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/>

## MAKE A PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE

Graduate students are required to make an online professional website. You can make a website here: <https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/>. See this guide on WordPress for beginners.

The main elements on the website should include:

1. **Biography** – brief description of your academic background e.g., undergraduate and master’s degree and universities, research interests, and academic achievements/awards e.g., scholarships/fellowships.

1. **Publications** – list of publications

1. **Research** – list of research projects you have worked on including the paper, code, or relevant research output.

1. **Curriculum Vitae** – list of all research, publications, educational background, industry experience, etc (see Angelique’s CV as an example).

## TRAVEL FUNDING

PhD students are expected to travel to conferences which has been a great highlight of pursuing the PhD. In the times we live in, I'll understand if students prefer to present remotely. All travel for conferences require funding so we will need to plan ahead with paper submissions.

The lab will sponsor first authors for conference publications. Also, I am usually happy to support low-cost local travel, for example, to symposiums.

If you want to attend a conference where you are not a first-author on a full paper, or you wish to attend other events (e.g., workshops, summer schools, etc), you will need to seek other funding to attend. Some sources include:

Cornell travel award: <https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/travel-funding-opportunities/>
For HRI only:
HRI Student volunteers - due 12/15
HRI Pioneers (doctoral consortium) - usually due in Dec or Jan.
Sig CHI travel grant (due 8/1, requires both ACM and SIGCHI student membership)  
ACM Student Support
Sometimes CRA has travel awards for women in CS: <http://cra.org/cra-w/scholarships-and-awards/>

## SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

The lab will host one lunch per semester. Pick restaurants you like to eat at! ;)
The lab will fund one social lunch per month to encourage students to socialize and build community. Just send the receipts to Angelique (no alcohol included).

## Writing

The Lab Writing Process

Our lab uses a collaborative writing process which involves:

1) completing a first draft – use the paper template. Use the comments as a rubric for expectations in each section.
2) send draft to two labmates for review and address their comments (See ‘The Lab Peer Review Process’ below)
3) send to Angelique for review
4) repeat 2 and 3 until complete

The Lab Peer Review Process

In our lab, we have an extensive peer review process at all stages of writing. This is to help all of you learn how to be good science writers, and help improve each other’s work.

As a reviewer, your goal is to give helpful, constructive feedback to labmates. You’re helping with three major things:
Improving the science / idea (conceptualizing, studying, etc)
Improving the writing high level (framing, contextualizing, etc)
Improving the writing low level (grammar, spelling)

Note - #3 is relatively easy. #1 and #2 take some extra thought to help out with. You want to help your labmates as much as you can with #1 and #2, particularly during early reviews. Those are the most critical early on.

Please give feedback as comments in the margins.

As an author, please go through these comments and consider them in your revision. For each comment, be sure you have replied to it. Either reply to the comment with “addressed” (meaning you addressed the comment in the revision), or reply with an explanation as to why you are not taking the advice.

Please never hit “resolve” on any comments. When I review I like to see what the other feedback was. This helps save time for all in the review process, so I don’t repeat comments, etc.

Writing Tips:
Use transitional words and phrases to improve the flow of your writing. [URL]
Use active voice (instead of passive voice) in your writing. It helps your writing flow, be clear and concise using the least amount of words to discuss your claims. [URL]

## CONFERENCES & JOURNALS

In robotics, CS, and HCI, the main publication venue is conferences. We also do journals sometimes, but less frequently. Conferences are a great chance to learn about the latest and greatest research, meet other researchers, see cool robot demos and competitions, and explore new parts of the world. They are generally one of the more fun perks of being an academic :)

## RECOMMENDED READINGS

SPSS by Andy Fields. This book provides resources on statistical analysis approaches for research projects.

Programming Robots with ROS, Morgan Quigley, Brian Gerkey, and William Smart. This book is useful for learning about Robot Operating System concepts such as topics, nodes, parameters, robot actions, services, and more. (Ask to borrow Angelique’s copy of the book if interested)

Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics, Gregory Dudek and Michael Jenkin. This book is useful for learning about programming mobile robots, sensors, localization, and navigation. (Ask to borrow Angelique’s copy of the book if interested)

How to Design and Report Experiments, Andy Field and Graham Hole. This book is useful for learning about experimental design, evaluation, sample size, etc. (Ask to borrow Angelique’s copy of the book if interested)

How to Talk to Anyone, Leil Lowndes. This book is great for learning how to ‘small talk’ people in social settings, particularly in professional environments. Sometimes it’s ok to NOT talk about research 😉 (Ask to borrow Angelique’s copy of the book if interested)

Human-Centered AI, Ben Schneiderman. This book is consistent with a lot of ideas discussed in the lab about human-centered AI – AI designed with stakeholders. Our hope is that this approach can help reduce bias, improve adoption of AI systems, and lead to improved usability. (Ask to borrow Angelique’s copy of the book if interested)

Thinking Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman. This book came up alot during our visit to BaseCamp (Nov 2022). The key idea is that healthcare workers try to optimize for think fast for tasks that are simple and easy to perform and they save time to think slow during high stress, uncertain situations.

The Academic Job Search Handbook, by Mary Morris Heiberger, Julia Miller Vick, Jennifer S. Furlong, Rosanne Lurie. This book was very useful for me during my academic jobs search.
